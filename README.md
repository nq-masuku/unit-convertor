The ktoc endpoint that produce an output amount in celsius when given an input amount in kelvin.

/conversions/ctok  service-method-name: getKelvinFromCelsius
The ctok endpoint that produce an output amount in kelvin when given an input amount in celsius.

/conversions/mtok  service-method-name: getKilometersFromMiles
The mtok endpoint that produce, when given an input amount in miles, an output amount in kilometers.

/conversions/ktom  service-method-name: getMilesFromKilometers
The ktom endpoint that produce, when given an input amount in kilometers, an output amount in miles.
